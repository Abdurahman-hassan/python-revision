# Python Revision Repository

Welcome to the Python Revision Repository! This repository contains educational materials from various Python tutorials available on Udemy, YouTube, and TutorialsPoint, along with enhancements provided by me. 

Whether you're new to Python or an experienced developer looking to deepen your understanding, you'll find plenty of content here to help you.

## About

The Python Revision Repository is my initiative to learn Python more effectively and also share knowledge with others. It is a collection of code snippets, comments, and explanations about different topics in Python, all organized in Jupyter notebooks for easy comprehension. 

The materials in this repo are based on various online resources, including Udemy courses, YouTube videos, and tutorials from the TutorialsPoint channel. While these materials provide the basis, I've also included my own enhancements and additional explanations to enrich the learning experience.

## Contents

The repository is divided into several sections, each dedicated to a different topic in Python:

- Basic Syntax
- Python Fundamentals
- Variables
- Data Types
- Flow Control
- Functions
- Exception Handling
- File I/O
- Array implementation
- File methods
- Keywords and Identifiers
- Python Tuples
- Data Structures
- Object-Oriented Programming with Python
- Functional Programming with Python
- Lambdas
- Decorators
- Generators
- Testing in Python
- Debugging
- Regular Expressions
- Comprehensions
- Modules
- Advanced Topics

Each section contains corresponding code examples and explanations.

The code is contained within Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) for interactive learning. Images are included to clarify certain concepts. If you have trouble viewing the images in the notebook preview, please clone this repository and run the notebooks on your local Jupyter environment.
